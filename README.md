- When the color picked by the player appears in the random sequence, a yellow square will appear
- If the color is also in the right place in the sequence, a black square will appear
- If a color doesn't appear in the random sequence, the square will remain gray

**When the sequence is guessed correctly, it will be revealed, and the game is won**
